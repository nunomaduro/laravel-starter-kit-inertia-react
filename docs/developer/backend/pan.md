# Pan (product analytics)

[Pan](https://github.com/panphp/pan) is a lightweight, privacy-focused PHP product analytics library used in this application to track **impressions**, **hovers**, and **clicks** on key UI elements. It does not collect personal data (no IP, user agent, or identifiers).

## How it works

- **Client:** Pan’s middleware injects a small JS library into HTML pages. Elements with a `data-pan="name"` attribute are tracked for view (impression), hover, and click. Events are batched and sent to the app.
- **Server:** Events are POSTed to `/pan/events` (route prefix configurable). Only the analytic **name** and **counters** are stored in the `pan_analytics` table.
- **Viewing data:** Run `php artisan pan` (optionally `--filter=name`) to see a table of analytics in the terminal.

## Usage

Add the `data-pan` attribute to any HTML element you want to track. **Names must contain only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.**

```html
<button data-pan="tab-profile">Profile</button>
<button data-pan="tab-settings">Settings</button>
<a href="/register" data-pan="auth-register-link">Sign up</a>
```

In React/Inertia, use the same attribute on components that render to DOM elements (e.g. `Button`, `Link`):

```tsx
<Button data-pan="auth-login-button">Log in</Button>
<Link href={register()} data-pan="welcome-register">Register</Link>
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::configurePan()` using `Pan\PanConfiguration`:

- **Allowed analytics (whitelist):** `PanConfiguration::allowedAnalytics([...])` — only these names are stored. This is the default in this app to avoid abuse (e.g. arbitrary names from client HTML).
- **Max analytics:** `PanConfiguration::maxAnalytics(10000)` — cap the number of distinct analytics records.
- **Unlimited:** `PanConfiguration::unlimitedAnalytics()` — no cap (use with care).
- **Route prefix:** `PanConfiguration::routePrefix('internal-analytics')` — default is `pan`, so the events URL is `/pan/events`.

When adding new tracked elements, add their `data-pan` value to the `allowedAnalytics` array in `AppServiceProvider`; otherwise they will not be persisted.

## Audit and troubleshooting

**Audit:** To ensure every tracked element is whitelisted, search the codebase for `data-pan` and `dataPan` (e.g. in `resources/js` and `resources/views`). For each distinct value (including template literals like `` `appearance-theme-${p.value}` `` — expand to concrete values such as `appearance-theme-default`, `appearance-theme-vega`), confirm it appears in `AppServiceProvider::configurePan()` `allowedAnalytics`. Add any missing names; events for names not in the whitelist are dropped by `DatabaseAnalyticsRepository`.

**Script not loading:** Pan’s middleware injects the script only when the response `Content-Type` is `text/html; charset=UTF-8`. For Inertia’s initial HTML load this should work. If events never appear, verify in the browser that the Pan script is present in the initial page source (not only after client-side navigation). Ensure the route that serves the app layout is not cached with a different content type.

**Whitelist gaps:** If you add new UI elements with `data-pan` but forget to whitelist them, events will be sent from the client but not stored. No error is shown; check the whitelist when adding new names.

## Artisan commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `php artisan pan` | Show analytics table (optionally `--filter=name`) |
| `php artisan pan:flush` | Delete all analytics records |

## Database

Table: `pan_analytics` (created by Pan’s migration). Columns: `id`, `name`, `impressions`, `hovers`, `clicks`.

## Where Pan is used in this app

- **Settings layout:** Sidebar nav items (e.g. `settings-nav-profile`, `settings-nav-password`, `settings-nav-appearance`).
- **Appearance:** Theme toggle tabs (`appearance-tab-light`, `appearance-tab-dark`, `appearance-tab-system`).
- **Auth:** Login button, register button, “Sign up” / “Log in” links, forgot-password button (`auth-*`).
- **Welcome:** Header links (Dashboard, Log in, Register, Blog, Changelog, Help, Contact) when visible (`welcome-*`).
- **App sidebar (authenticated):** Main nav (Dashboard, Organizations, Billing, Blog, Changelog, Help, Contact) and footer (API docs, Repository, Documentation) (`nav-*`).
- **User dashboard:** Quick action buttons (Edit profile, Settings, Export profile PDF, Contact support, Email templates for super-admin, Product analytics for admin) and the Analytics card link (`dashboard-quick-*`, `dashboard-card-view-analytics`).

See `AppServiceProvider::configurePan()` for the full whitelist.

## Viewing analytics (hierarchy)

- **User dashboard (Inertia):** Users with **access admin panel** see a **Product analytics** quick action and an **Analytics** card that links to the admin Product Analytics page. This gives admins a direct path from the app dashboard to analytics.
- **Filament dashboard:** The **Product Analytics** stats widget appears on the Filament dashboard (`/admin`) for users with access: totals (impressions, clicks, hovers) and top element by clicks, each linking to the full Product Analytics page.
- **Filament → Analytics → Product Analytics** (`/admin/analytics/product`): Full page with a table of all tracked elements (name, impressions, hovers, clicks) and the same header stats. Description notes that data is **application-wide** (not scoped by organization).
- **Hierarchy:** Pan does not support tenant or organization scoping; analytics are **application-wide**. There is no separate org-level analytics view; all product analytics are in the admin panel. Only users with `access admin panel` (or `bypass-permissions`) can see the Product Analytics page, widget, and dashboard links.
